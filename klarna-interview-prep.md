# klarna-interview-prep

The first round consists for 3 interviews: Coding/Architecture/Behavioural

## Coding & Architectural Skills Interview

> The assessment will be sent to you by the engineer 24 hours before the interview.

The interview will involve using **miro.com**, so it would be appreciated to have a look around this tool beforehand, although this is not required. Please also make sure that chrome has access to shared your screen for the coding exerciseThis part will be 60 minutes.

> The link video & call: coordinator will send to you soon.

The skills session is a chance for you to showcase how you think, the questions you ask as well as how you solve the problem, so be sure to ask those key questions that will help you to come to the correct solution quickly.

During this skills session, this will involve a pair programming exercise where you will walk the interviewer through how you would design a new system from the ground up.

The interviewer is looking for you to follow a similar method to how we work here at Klarna.

We operate a test-first approach so take this into consideration. Think about how you’re going to design the solution, deploy and monitor.

Think `end2end` as that’s exactly what our teams do as we don’t have separate teams that deploy or conduct QA.

Make sure you understand both the business and technical needs.

The interviewer is not just assessing you on your technical ability, but also seeking to understand how you interact with other Engineers and how you go about gathering requirements.

## Behavioural Interview

> The behavioural interview will contain questions corresponding to Klarna’s 8 leadership principles which can be found here.

**The link video & call:** Have been sent to you already.

Please have a good read of these and retrospect on specific scenarios or times where you have followed these principles. Be prepared to discuss previous experience where you have showcased these values:Try to use the STAR method to form your responses.

- **Situation** (describe the situation you were in)

- **Task** (explain the task you had to complete)

- **Action** (describe the specific actions you took)

- **Result** (finish by explaining the results of your efforts)This interview is a chance for you to also find out a bit more about the technical team and how they operate, so be ready to ask any questions.

Let your personality come out as above all they want to see what it will be like working with you.

> Important - Please ensure that you have a good internet connection that is strong enough for video to video along with a stable enough connection for screen sharing.

## Key points:

### Architecture

In the architecture interview, the candidate needs to explain your solution fully. Also, remember the important requirements for moving the project to production, like logging, monitoring, and testing. Ask questions to clarify both functional and non-functional requirements. Think about how you move to the next step.

### Prototype

Explain your solution

### Production

Mention some important aspects necessary to move the project into production, like multiple environments, logging, and monitoring.

### Coding

Frontend/BackEnd project for the coding exercise. Understand what project you are doing, and describe it quite well. Think about refactoring the “Header” component. Try to solve the problem independently and understand the React fragment component.
Think of functionality to the app (view email on click); function responsible for generating it and updating the test cases and understand how to show the email on the page.

Don't forget to:

- Solve the problems
- Solve the tasks on the coding exercise by asking for clarifying information to help yourself to solve the problem and optimise the solution.
- Ask for requirements-
- Think about logging and monitoring
